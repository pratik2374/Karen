# Karen - AI Voice Assistant

 Karen is a Python-based voice assistant that operates on user commands through voice inputs and provides desired results using speech output. It can perform various tasks such as:

### Telling quotes
### Providing the current time
### Opening Google, Google Classroom, and other system applications
###  Searching YouTube videos and playing them directly
### Understanding user intent using an LLM model, allowing flexible command inputs

# Features

### Voice Command Execution: Operates entirely through voice input

### Natural Language Understanding: Uses an LLM model to interpret user queries without requiring exact string matches

### YouTube Integration: Searches YouTube for queries and can even play specific videos (e.g., "play 3rd video")

### System & Web App Control: Opens Google, Google Classroom, and system applications based on voice commands

### Quote and Time Responses: Provides inspirational quotes and tells the current time

> ## Future Enhancements

To take Karen to the next level, future improvements will include:

### Computer Vision (OpenCV): Enabling interaction using gestures or facial recognition

### Enhanced LLM Integration: Improving user experience with more advanced AI models

### Expanded Application Control: Managing more system and web applications seamlessly

### Emotion Detection: Identifying if the user is feeling sad and providing motivational quotes

### Adaptive Learning: Learning and improving based on user feedback and interactions
